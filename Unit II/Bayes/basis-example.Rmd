Draw some x-values and compute the function `cos(x)` on them.
```{r}
n <- 1000
x <- runif(n, -2*pi, 2*pi)
y <- cos(x)
```

Fit a spline using the piecewise continuous linear basis (using strategically chosen cutpoints, since we know the function).
```{r}
knots <- 2*pi * c(-1/2, 0, 1/2)
X <- cbind(1, x,
	(x - knots[1])*(x > knots[1]),
	(x - knots[2])*(x > knots[2]),
	(x - knots[3])*(x > knots[3])
)
Beta.hat <- solve(t(X) %*% X, t(X) %*% y)
```

Plot the original function and the fitted spline.
```{r}
plot(x, y, ylim = c(-1.2, 1.2), pch = 20, cex = 0.5)
points(x, X %*% Beta.hat, col = "red", pch = 20, cex = 0.5)
```
